## 🧪 Flask Practice Projects

This repository contains **multiple small Flask applications** created as part of hands-on practice and experimentation.

Each project focuses on specific concepts such as:
- Routing and request handling
- Template rendering (Jinja)
- Form submission and validation
- Basic authentication flows
- Working with databases
- Structuring small Flask apps

These projects are **intentionally scoped** to explore ideas quickly and reinforce backend fundamentals.  
They are not production applications, but complete, runnable exercises built through learning by doing.
